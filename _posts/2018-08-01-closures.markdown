* Genarality: A closure is a property in which a function can access the variables(temporary/out of scope/not static or global) that are out of scope of current function.
    **Eg:
        {% highlight ruby %}
        int value = 2;
        auto funct = [&](int a){value = a;};
        {% endhighlight %}
